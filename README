The app runs as intended and has the necessary information. The tabs are the default from when you open
titanium which is easy and I see no problem with using it.

As far as looks the colors aren't exactly visually appealing and the text could be sized and formatted to 
be more interesting to look at. Also the picture that was added does not show up on any of my emulators.

There is no code to make the app adopt different devices. I personnally couldn't figure this out either 
but chaning all of the font sizes and formatting numbers to percentages did a good job for when the app is
ran on a different sized device.
